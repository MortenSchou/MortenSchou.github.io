abstract = {We present an automated what-if analysis tool AalWiNes for MPLS networks which allows us to verify both logical properties (e.g., related to the policy compliance) as well as quantitative properties (e.g., concerning the latency) under multiple link failures. Our tool relies on weighted pushdown automata, a quantitative extension of classic automata theory, and takes into account the actual dataplane configuration, rendering it especially useful for debugging. In particular, our tool collects the different router forwarding tables and then builds a pushdown system, on which quantitative reachability is performed based on an expressive query language. Our experiments show that our tool outperforms state-of-the-art approaches (which until now have been restricted to logical properties) by several orders of magnitude; furthermore, our quantitative extension only entails a moderate overhead in terms of runtime. The tool comes with a platform-independent user interface and is publicly available as open-source, together with all other experimental artefacts.},

abstract={Thanks to recent e-commerce growth, the parcel delivery industry is booming. We demonstrate a system that provides a practical solution for scheduling and planning parcel delivery routes. Given a parcel delivery workload, e.g., the number of parcels to be delivered and the sizes of the parcels, the system tries to identify a set of delivery routes such that the workload is satisfied and the total delivery cost is minimized. The system is developed on top of aSTEP, a spatio-temporal data analytics platform developed at Aalborg University, and is tested with parcel delivery workloads provided by a large logistic company in Denmark.}}
