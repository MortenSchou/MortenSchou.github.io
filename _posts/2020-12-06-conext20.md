description: My first presentation at a conference
---
Last week I had my first conference presentation at the CoNEXT 2020 conference.

While a physical conference in Barcelona definitely would have been great, my experience of the virtual conference was generally good. 

I presented our tool [AalWiNes](https://aalwines.cs.aau.dk/) for dataplane verification of MPLS networks. 
The [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3386367.3431308) comes with an [online demonstration website](https://demo.aalwines.cs.aau.dk/).

### Video Presentation
Since the conference was held online, we were asked to pre-record a video presentation, which was played at the conference. After the video, I was answering questions live.
